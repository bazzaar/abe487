1.  Title of the paper and authors

Recent Advances in the Microbiology of the Built Environment 
Theodore Konya & James A. Scott

2.  Define the general topic, issue, or area of research (3-4 sentences max)

As humans spend a disproportionately large amount of time inside buildings, it's a good thing to
study the microbial content of the air, dust, and surfaces. People have been trying this for 300
years (since van Leewenhoek). Our ability to understand the built environment (or really any
microbial community) has mostly been limited by the available technologies. The advent of
high-throughput sequencing (culture-independent) allows for a much deeper and broader window into
this world than we've ever known.

3.  What methods are they using to approach this problem (a bulleted list works well)?

High-throughput, next-generation, DNA

4.  What are the overall conclusions the authors reach? (3-4 sentences)

We're able to characterize microbial communities like never before. While that's pretty
interesting, just describing a community is simplistic.  Microbial studies of the built environment should integrate data from "building science, materials engineering, industrial hygiene, and population health" to create richer, more complex models that could suggest improvement to engineering or alter health outcomes.

5.  How does this advance research in your metagenomics topic area?

It points to the need to do more than just identify species but to factor in knowledge from other fields to create ideas for improving the way we build and live in our buildings.
