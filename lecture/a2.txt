1.  Four main advantages of NGS over classical Sanger sequencing are?

- faster
- cheaper
- easier
- more data (depth of coverage)

2.  In what two ways is NGS faster than Sanger?

- Multiple samples can be processed in parallel
- Can sequence whole genome 

3.  How much did it cost to sequence the first human genome?

About $3 billion.

4.  How much does it cost today using NGS technology to sequence a human genome?

About $1,000.

5.  How is metagenomic sequencing different from genome sequencing?

Metagenomic sequencing uses DNA from an unknown number of organisms in a 
community rather than isolating the DNA from a single species.
