1) What's the difference between using single and double quotes with 
   the "print" function?

Single quotes will not interpolate escape characters (\t, \n, etc.) or
variables -- these will be printed literally as they appear.

2) Name at least one way to get Perl to execute a shell command such as "ls."

system("ls");

my $dir_listing = `ls`;

3) Describe how "use strict" alters the way Perl makes you write code.

It makes Perl complain if variables are not declared thereby preventing
one from accidentally misspelling a variable name.
