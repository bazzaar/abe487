Given this:

 my %fruit = (
   apple   => 'red',
   orange  => 'orange',
   banana  => 'yellow',
   grape   => 'green',
 );

1) How would one get the color of "banana"?

my $color = $fruit{'banana'}

2) How would one generate this string from the hash?

  green, orange, red, yellow

join ', ', sort values %fruit;

3) How would one add "peach => pink" to the hash?

$fruit{'peach'} = 'pink';
