1) What is the benefit of the pragma "use autodie"?

You don't have to 'open ... or die "..."' as Perl will automatically 
generate a useful error message and stop execution of the program.

2) In Perl, there are three ways to print messages to STDERR (print STDERR, 
   warn, die).  From the shell (bash), how does one redirect STDERR into 
   a file?

    program 1>out 2>err

3) The old way to open files in Perl was to use just two arguments, the 
   first of which is a global symbol 

 open FILEHANDLE, '>myfile.txt';

This is bad bad bad and none of my students would ever do this.  The proper way is to use the three-argument form with a scalar:

 open my $filehandle, $mode, 'myfile.txt';

Where you see $mode, tell me the three symbols I can use to indicate to Perl that I want to open for:

- read
- write
- append

Hint: They are exactly the same as the redirect flags in bash.

  read   = <
  write  = >
  append = >>
